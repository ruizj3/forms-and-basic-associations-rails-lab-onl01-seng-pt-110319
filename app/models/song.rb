  # This is some high-power Rails magic
  # accepts_nested_attributes_for lets us create multiple Notes when creating a
  # Song. That's pretty awesome. However we can define a proc (a small in-line
  # method) that is passed the attributes that are about to be handed to the
  # to-be-created Note and cancel the operation (reject_if) if they are judged
  # to be invalid (i.e. the content attribute is empty). Soooo...powerful!
